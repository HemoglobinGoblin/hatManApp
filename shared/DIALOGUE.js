In fact, everything outside just looks wrong. The bright red light was coming from behind the trees. You tried looking up to see if the light was coming from above but you weren't able to see past the crowns of the trees. "Where am I?" you think to youself. Out of no where, the red light begins to fade and quickly dissapears. \n \n It's pitch dark outside now... \n \n There is only one option left. Go ahead and check the door.`

It's not that you don't understand the language. You know those are english words but something isn't letting you piece them together. \n \n The right has as door with two metal latches in addition to the deadbolt. That's strange... why would there be that many latches on the door? The only reason you notice a crack on the door is because you see that same red light shine through. The light dissapears afer a few seconds. You've seen this happen before... \n \n \n \n Your heart starts punding faster and faster as that feeling of being watched returns.

You recognize that it's a phone and it bring a small sense of relief. The phone is on a dest still vibrating. In a panic, you run up to the phone and try to navigate it to call someone.

The vibrating phone suddendly stops buzzing and you open your eyes to see what's going on. \n \n The room starts getting darker and darker. Your vision starts vibrating and you try to scream but nothing comes out.

You look at your arms and see little holes forming all over your skin. Little worms start crawling out of some of the holes. \n \n "The light is causing this" you think to yourself. \n \n You look up and see a public bathroom facility.

You still can't find where the light is coming from. You aren't able to find cover and your legs give out. Not because you've tired them out but becuase the amount of holes has rendered them useless.

As you look down at your arms you notice that the floor is covered in a black liquid. As you observe it you briefly see your reflection move but you didn't pay too much attention. The ripples in the liquid were preventing a clear image. \n \n Trying to avoid slipping, you walk up to the end of the facility and go to hide in the last bathroom stall. It wont budge... You can't fit under the stall door and you're not able to fit over it so climbing is not a viable option. You push and pull but nothing. Then suddendly... you feel the door vibrating \n \n The door explodes open and twists you from the waist 180 degrees. In excruciating pain you tilt forwar ointo the sink and look in the mirror. You see your reflection as you scream in pain. The reflection of your face doesn't have eyes or a mouth but you know that's you screaming... As you continue to look at your reflection you see it reach out of the mirror and it grabs your face. This send you into a blinding white hot pain. \n \n  You lose consciousness.... \n \n  Let go...`

Quickly looking over you notice that same silhouette on the ceiling. No matter how hard you try, you just can't regain control of your body. \n \n Knowing that this could be the end of your life. You shut your eyes and embrace what's to come but nothing happens. After opening your eyes you see that the silhouette has disappeared. \n \n Finally, you're able to move your body.
